### 4. Probability Distribution R Functions

For most of the classical distributions, base R provides probability distribution functions (p), density functions (d), quantile functions (q), and random number generation (r).
p - probability distribution function
q - quantile, the inverse DF for a continuous random variable or the quantile function
d - density, the probability mass function (PMF) for a discrete random variable or the probability density function (PDF) for a continuous random variable
r - a random variable having the specified distribution
 * For a continuous distribution use p and q functions
 * For a discrete distribution use d function that calculates the density

### 5. Continuous Probability Distributions
 
 All major text books always give these three continuous disctributions as examples: 
  1. Uniform probability distribution
  2. Exponential probability distribution
  3. Normal probability distribution
   

There are two major differences between discrete and continuous probability distributions:

1. The probability of a continuous random variable assuming a particular value is zero. Instead, the probability of the continuous random variable assumes a value within some given interval. For a discrete random variable, the probability function f(x) provides the probability that the random variable assumes a particular value. With continuous random variables we should use the  probability density function f(x). The difference is that the probability density function does not directly provide probabilities. However, the area under the graph of f(x) corresponding to a given interval does provide the probability that the continuous random variable x assumes a
value in that interval. So when we compute probabilities for continuous random variables we
are computing the probability that the random variable assumes any value in an interval (Anderson et al).

2. The probability of a continuous random variable assuming a value within some given interval from x1 to x2 is defined to be the area under the graph of the probability density function between x1 and x2. Because a single point is an interval of zero width, this implies that the probability of a continuous random variable assuming any particular value exactly is zero. It also means that the probability of a continuous random variable assuming a value in any interval is the same whether or not the endpoints are included.
The calculation of the expected value and variance for a continuous random variable involves integral calculus (Anderson et al).

The other properties of the probability distrbution introduced for discrete variables also hold true for continuous:
 1. The total area under the graph of the probability density function f(x) is equal to 1
 2. f(x) is always positive

Very important note: the height of a probability density function is not a probability!

 5.1. Uniform probability distribution
What does it mean a uniform probability distribution? Basically it means that it has constant probability. Classical example is the flight time. When we say the probability of a flight time is uniformly distributed, we say that this probability is the same within 1-minute interval as within any other 1-minute interval contained in the larger interval between a and b. So With every 1-minute interval being equally likely, the random variable x is said to have a uniform probability distribution. Consider a discrete counterpart (discrete uniform distribution) of rolling a dice where every outcome is equally likely and the probability of every outcome is 1/6.
When a random variable is uniformly distributed its probability is proportional to the length of the interval.  The distribution describes an experiment where there is an arbitrary outcome that lies between certain bounds. The bounds are defined by the parameters, a and b, which are the minimum and maximum values. Graphically, the uniform probability density function is portrayed as a rectangle where (b-a) is the base and (1/(b-a)) is the height. The height is equal to the value of the the probability density function. The probability density function of the continuous uniform distribution is:
f(x)= 1/(b - a), for a <= x <= b
and
f(x) = 0 for elsewhere
Uniform probability = width * height

```{r}
# To show that indeed it's a uniform dictribution:
hist(runif(n = 10000,min = 5,max = 15),breaks = 30)

# punif == CDF:
plot(punif(q=10:20,min = 10,max = 20))
```

Example:
On average, 30-minute television sitcoms have 22 minutes of programming (CNBC,
February 23, 2006). Assume that the probability distribution for minutes of programming
can be approximated by a uniform distribution from 18 minutes to 26 minutes.

Given f(x) = 1/(26-18)
```{r}
#a. What is the probability a sitcom will have 25 or more minutes of programming?
punif(q = 25,min = 18,max = 26,lower.tail = FALSE)

# b. What is the probability a sitcom will have between 21 and 25 minutes of programming?
1 - punif(q = 21,min = 18,max = 26,lower.tail = TRUE)+punif(q = 25,min = 18,max = 26,lower.tail = FALSE)

# c. What is the probability a sitcom will have more than 10 minutes of commercials or other nonprogramming interruptions?
punif(q = 20,min = 18,max = 26,lower.tail = TRUE)
```
